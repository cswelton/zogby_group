### ToDo
- Update tied logic. Currently, ties award full amount to each. 
  This will change to instead evenly divide points among tied players.
- Track first 16 rounds and replacement rounds on site. The FedexCup is based on first 16 rounds with 5 being eligible for replacement.
  Currently, replaced round logic is automatic for points generation,
  we need to be able to easily see which rounds have been replaced and how many replacement rounds are left.
- Rebrand Race For 8 into simple FedexCup point totals tracking.
- Automate round tracking based on FedExCup rules. Using a config file that sets the start/end dates and
  requirements for an "official" round, create logic that automatically excludes unofficial rounds from the
  fedex cup point tracking website.
