## The FedEx Cup

The FedEx Cup is a season long points based competition for Zogby Group playas.
Points are awarded during each round, and at the end of the season the top 5 players are paid out.

### Teams
* 2x per month a draft will be held either in person or on GroupMe. 
Team Captains will be A,B,C and D players with a monthly rotation. 
Players will be flighted prior to the draft and Captains will pick one player from each flight. 
The last person to pick in the 1st round will pick two players in a row and that will continue each round until teams are completed.														

* The remaining rounds will be teams created by a committee consisting of a Player from each Flight. 
They will pick the teams collectively and send them out via GroupMe the night prior to play. 
This will also be a rotation and tracked so everyone has an opportunity to be involved.														

* We will mix teams up a couple times per month by putting different flights together versus always playing with your team as this was a positive choice discussed by many in the group.
						
### Format
We created a points system based on data from 2020â€™s weekly results and number of rounds played by each player. 
This will be a running tally of each official BBC round defined below. 
The season official start date is projected to be April 2nd  running through Oct 1st. 
Final payouts will be based on total revenue collected and be based on the system below. 

- You must have a minimum of 12 rounds to qualify for final payout.  
- Your first 16 rounds through this date range will determine point totals. 
- You will be able to replace up to 5 of the 16 round. The software will automatically replace your lowest round
  with a higher one until you have exhausted your 5 replacement rounds.
- Points are allocated for each round as follows:
- **Front Side Team Bet** *2 points*
- **Back Side Team Bet** *2 points*
- **Overall Team Bet** *2 points*
- **Flight  Winner (A,B,C,D)** *2 points*
- **Skins** *1 point*

### Funding
There will be a $100 entry fee due prior to the first official day of the season paid to the CFO via Venmo.
Each official round there will be $5 per person signup charge.

| Finish | Payout |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1st | 38% |
| 2nd | 25% |
| 3rd | 18% |
| 4th | 13% |
| 5th | 6% |

### Rules
USGA rules apply to all play.
If you are called out for any rules infraction by a fellow player 
this will not be handled anonymously after the fact the discussion needs to be had a the point of the infraction.  
Penalties include fines, suspension and possible expulsion.

We will be playing **1 ball** off the first tee. Unless noted, we will be playing the ball as it lies every round.
**No Gimmies**, play like you would in an official tournament.

**It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure the correct score is noted for each player.** If your not sure, ask.
When your finished with your round, check your scores to make sure whats entered is correct.
Pay attention to your playing partners scores and if you see an incorrect score then sort it out. This thing
only works if everyone maintains score integrity.
